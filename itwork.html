			<h2>IT Work - Interview a Professional</h2>
			<hr>

				<p>
					<h3>Please tell us about your IT Work. What exactly do you do?</h3>
					<p>
						I'm called a technical account manager. So I look after clients and make sure that they're technically advised and in Salem stuff and make sure they're all happy. That's kind of it in a nutshell, I'm usually the place that everything rolls down to. If it goes wrong.
					</p>

				<h3>Tell us about the industry you work in.</h3>
				<p>I do work with in an MSP (Managed Service Provider), so we basically do the IT departments of companies htat don't have IT departments</p>
				<h3>Is it when they outsource?</h3>
				<p>Yeah, for doing outsourcing. So rather than them having an IT manager and lots of little minions (subordinates) to run around and fix stuff, they have us. We have lots of companies that way we can have an economy of scale of having (last count) we have have 400 staff.
				</p>
				<h3>What kind of work do you do?</h3>
				<p>
				I write proposals, based on based on company needs. I wright them up and get them signed off and make sure we've got project scopes in there and then hand it over for new projects and then also, for the day-to-day business as usual stuff I am usually is an escalation point for tickets if they're taking too long or are not going the right way, or the customers unhappy or happy. It's usually unhappy. Then they’ll escalate it up to me. This is where the where the T and technical account manager comes in. I'll still get into the back-end systems, I 've still got from my accounts. I've still got sign into 365. I've got access directly onto their VM Ware hosting, you know, so that I'm when I'm doing upgrades, we got to go in there and make sure what versions you've got. What sort of setup I've got within their V sphere and being able to make sure we got the right licensing within 365 to do to do any kind of stuff. They’re going to roll out MFA. For example, you know you've got to be able get into the back end. Make sure the licensing is all there. So you're still going to have your hands a little bit dirty. 
				</p>
		</div>

		<div class="card2">
		<h3>What are all the different people you interact with in your work? Tell us a little bit about them.</h3>
		<p>
		I deal with the accounts team, so I've got to sign off on all the invoices before they go out. Then I've got to make sure they're paid, so if they are overdue, it gets escalated up to me internally. I deal with the accounts receivable department.
		I will get orders to do, like basic licensing quote, some hardware quotes. I deal with the orders department and the shipping within purchasing. 
		As well as writing up the technical side of things. I deal with Project tech (technical staff) and the day-to-day techs and their managers. 
		We have what are called pods, so they'll have groups of groups of different resources under a leader and they’ll work for different companies, so if there's a certain company that needs a certain thing, then you go through that pod. Then from above that I have my estate manager who I report to directly, and then we've got, you know, the head of the account management for Australia, which I also report to. 
		There are my peers, we've got two direct account managers, there are another two who work in voice comms so their account managers and we're trying to do a bit more crossover, but they're looking after their own team and their own accounts. Although we sort of interact amongst each other. 
		</p>
		<h3>What about your interactions with clients or investors?</h3>
		<p>
		Depends on the company. In some cases, it’s the owner. With the day-to-day within the companies, they tend to put IT across to their finance department, so a lot of who I deal with are finance managers or CFO's as a general rule, which is good and bad, mostly bad because they no technical knowledge, the good is that they are heavy ability of sign off on things. </p>
		<h3>Please tell us about your interactions with other IT professionals</h3>
		<p>
		Sometimes I have to get involved in that where will have third party people involved, so we've got to escalate it up. Right now, we're doing a roll out of a of a mail platform which I don't really want to do, but it's one that we're having the escalator up a bit to the developers at the software, I'm in on those meetings. He's got a very old exchange box which is out of out of support and everyone else has moved to 365. He still wants to keep it internally, but he doesn't want to pay the licensing fee for a new. On Prem exchange box, he found another company to replace. So let's say we don't have a lot of expertise in in the back end mail exchange box.

		<h3>What aspects of your work do you spend most time on?</h3>
		<p>
		Yes. Admin, yeah, probably. 70%. What did I do last week? I had Friday off, but Wednesday and Thursday was it was invoicing. I think they had 60 odd invoices to process and those two days I mean to be done by Friday. But you know the jam into two days rather than three. And then they've had another 27 today. 
		</p>
		<h3>Which aspects of your work do you find most challenging?</h3>
		<p>
		Depends on who I have to deal with and what mistakes I have to clean up. I mean there is a lot of burnout in technical account management. They they tend to. You'll see a lot of jobs advertised for it and you'll see there's a lot of turnover. Keeping up to-date with the industry certifications, I did 40 something set exams over a year now is having to do that to keep current. When you're doing those sorts of things you don't enjoy it. I got to be a reasonably high-end Microsoft guy, so it frustrates me absolute hell out of me when I see you know, some of the level ones flapping around trying to get something done. When I could really just could get in there and do it.
		</p>
		<h3>What qualifications do you believe to be necessary for success in your field?</h3>
		<p>
		Yeah, I did a bachelors in IT and management. And then then went and did a masters with a major in IT. Which was good, it covered sort of stuff don't get in your in your heavy, IT focused bachelor degree. It was more on culture and ethics and business systems. I did my bachelors at Vic Uni (Victoria University) we did a management course and a legal. There aren’t many pathways to take other than University. The management is usually tech going into a tech, into a team lead. Then heading into ops manger of down the sales path.	
		</p>
		<h3>What do you wish you knew before entering IT</h3>
		<p>
		Maybe I would have gone more heavily into some of the networking side of things, so I was reasonably heavily into Cisco stuff, but you know, maybe going off and I was tempted at one point there to go do my CCIE (Cisco Certified Internetwork Expert)
		</p>
		</div>
		<div class="card2">
		<h3>What advice would you have for people trying to enter the IT industry?</h3>
		<p>
		Don't underestimate yourself. If you've been doing it for a few years, you will be amazed actually at the little bits and pieces you picked up, you know. And you've got to step up every now and then, you know you get your yourself. Comfortable enough but just realized that every time you step up into a new place or a higher level, where your the escalation point where a level one says I can't fix this in 365. I need you to step in or you get a TAM coming to you saying we're escalating this up to you. You're not going know all the answers, but you're going know how to look at it and look at the big picture and work out where we're actually heading. It's that's one of the hardest things when your problem solving. You're always looking at the trees rather than the wood. You can get yourself stuck in there a little bit, but don't underestimate yourself. You've got to step up every now and then and get uncomfortable again. It's the hardest thing. It’s the step ups. You know, when you're when you're out on site and you're looking at stuff even never seen before because I've got some plugins into something or they're using a different router or a different switch and, but the overall fundamentals of it haven't changed. You’re never going to go in there and now everything  and being able to back yourself and just go look up. I can work the problem. 
		</p>
		<h3>How have you seen the IT change during your career?</h3>
		<p>
		But you go into a course now and all the syllabus from 20 years ago was almost irrelevant, apart from maybe some really basic stuff like the OSI model But all of the languages of changed all of the even their apps. You know, like you'd say, yes, he did office back then and we are certified in it an exchange. But that's entirely different animal nowadays, so the tech cited that doesn't build on it like you don't need to do 365. You don't need to know how to do a on Prem Exchange Server like you just don't. Unless you're working with someone who's doing cloud services and you're having to put new bits bit of tin (hardware) all the time, then you're probably not going to see it now. Wears every job I used to do would be an on Prem server. We had a build them and pulling apart and put it back together and you know do warranty calls on him and all that sort of stuff. You just don't see it as much now.

			<h3>What technology do you see now that you couldn’t have possibly thought of when you started in IT?</h3>
			<p>
			There are no real lines of demarcation anymore. Work PCs used to just be for work up, you know, and there's no interaction between your home devices and your phones and your office setups and the integration between it all. You know all of the lift systems that now integrate, and all of the environmental stuff. Like the IoT and all the other bits and pieces that are attached to that match just growing, like cars. And devices using the same apps, that's the thing, you’re using the same base, it becomes transportable. Then doing the voice recognition to be able to link all the backends together so that you really don't need to necessarily know about it.
			</p>
			<h3>How has your roll changed over the years?</h3>
			<p>
			I think first I teach up was 1990 while I was finishing high school.  one of my first jobs after Uni was at CSIRO, that was with all the backbone hub stuff, I saw it when it was all connected into ARPANET and after that I went on and worked as a high-end Microsoft technician. Once I had decided to move over into a management position I have worked in accounts management since.
			</p>
			<h3>Have you ever had to completely abort the rollout of a new technology?</h3>
			<p>
			No, I haven't got it that bad, although we have had to pull something out within about three or four months after finishing the rollout that was a BlackBerry BES (BlackBerry Enterprise Server) server. Just because blackberries all of a sudden just fell off the face of the Earth, everyone went to the iPhone.
			</p>
			<h3>Where do you think the industry will be in 10 years?</h3>
			<p>
			I think we will see a move towards AI. How far I’m not sure. It was all individual PCs, and then we went to Minis and mainframe. I was all running terminals and for all intensive purposes. They were clouds basically, they hosted RS6000 systems and AS400’s and they're all sitting in in server banks. And then they would be on site terminals that would be going up to them and then at a certain point people decided that it was better to bring it all back in house, so that's where you had local servers and a lot of the processing power back on the PC's so it was. I wouldn’t be surprised if we see them bring everything back on prem again.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="card2">
			<h3>What sort of skills did you have to develop overtime that helped in your day to day dealings with staff?</h3>
			<p>
				The ability to be able to speak to people that means you know you're a bit of a rarity if you can. If you can act as an interface between an technical side of things and the and the people side of things
			</p>
			<h3>What is the one main thing that every IT operations manager needs?</h3>
			<p>
				I don't know how you'd say this in the nicest possible term, but the ability to eat a shit sandwich. Going there knowing that that you know the office is on fire and the fires on fire and everything you're going to walk into in there is on fire. And you know you're going to have to walk in there, you know. And that is an interesting way to start your day. It hurts your soul.
				It is the ability to take responsibility without admitting liability.
				We will work on that. Here's our way forward. You know, keep the big picture. That's what it is. Keeping a big picture.
