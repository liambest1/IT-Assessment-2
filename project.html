					<h2>Project Idea</h2>
					<hr>
					<h3>Overview</h3>
					<p>
					A website that focuses on short live online classes at a reasonable rate, which gives users a tailored learning experience. This website will be called QuickClass. When creating a user profile, students will input previous learning data as well as their goals for learning outcomes. Users will then receive recommendations for courses that they can complete in their chosen fields. It will function between long-term online classes like that of online study at university and online video libraries with a quiz at the end similarly to other platforms like LinkedIn Learning or Go1. This website will provide short 1-3 sessions per course in all kinds of hobbies, certification preparation, or workplace compliance. It will have assigned homework and corrected scores. This will be accessed mainly through a web browser but a companion mobile app will also be available for any text component. There will be one-on-one tutoring on specific subject areas regarding our provided classes.
					</p>
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					<p>The key motivator in the creation of this project is to assist people who struggle to do online learning without accountability or any ongoing assistance. There are currently dozens of e-learning platforms that provide educational videos and quizzes on a wide variety of topics and that number jumps into the hundreds if you count websites that have focused topics, but none of them offer live short courses in one-off webinars or boot camps. This website will include the recordings of the webinars and tests (unmarked) for a cheaper price for those that need a lower price. There will be an offer for enterprises licensing to then create an account for their employees to assist with all kinds of workplace compliance that can then be completed in groups in a conference room or individually from their homes.</p>
					<h3>Description</h3>
					<h4>General Description</h4>
					<p>
					QuickClass is designed to be an easy-to-use home learning tool. It will allow users to attend live recordings of sessions that are limited of 6 hours’ worth of lessons, with up to 12 hours of homework. This is to make the learning approachable and easy to manage for people who are already working on a busy schedule. Whether that be a demanding employment, or a full-time parent. QuickClass will allow people to further their education from the comfort of their home in short manageable sessions that will provide the quality education they desire with a workload they can manage.</p>
				</div>
			
				<div class="card2">
					<h4>Online Approachability</h4>
					<p>The reason that an online approach to the courses was chosen is for the ease of students. The students can attend the live sessions and have an interaction with their teacher, and then the homework is set when required which allows for the student to complete their studies in their own time from the comfort of their home and without the stress of having to attend venues at a certain time. It also allows for independent research if the student develops a further interest in the course they are enrolled in, allowing the growth of enthusiasm and education in a low-pressure environment. The courses are designed around hard to manage schedules and will be able to be organized at various times in the day. The sessions will have opening times from anywhere between Midday to 9pm at night.</p>
					<h4>One-to-One Sessions</h4>
					<p>One-to-One sessions can be offered to individuals who require it. Students wishing to do this can organize with their teachers for a tutoring session agreed upon by both parties. The teachers will have the final say on what works for them as they are primarily in charge of the course structure and can say no if the requests are unreasonable in order to protect the teacher’s privacy, give them time for their personal commitments and other classes. A student will not be limited to these One-to-One sessions. However, it will be disclosed that a student does need to be respectful of the needs of the teacher.</p>
					<h4>The Course Time Limits</h4>
					<p>The reason that QuickClass has been designed to fit into a 6-hour window is to allow for people with demanding lives that do not allow for the freedom that a full-time student may have to work on their studies, are still able to study in a productive and efficient manner. For a student to achieve a proper education within the 6-hour time limit, the work may need to be reinforced outside of the 6-hour meeting. For this reason, a teacher may allocate up to 12 hours of homework. This is so that the student can focus on what has been taught and reinforce their learning to gain a better understanding of the content. The homework will always be things relevant and taught withing the live video sessions. The courses are not arbitrarily made to extend to the 6-hour block, as short courses with teachers could be arranged that could run to a time of as short as 15 minutes if the content does not require it. The 6-hour limit is made in order to keep the courses manageable regardless of the schedule.</p>
					<h4>Live Content</h4>
					<p>The course is designed to be a live interactive session between the student and the teacher. This will allow for the student to achieve the best understanding possible as they are able to ask questions and gain answers with clarification and feedback as soon as their questions arise. As many people may find learning on their own difficult, the course is designed to give a helping hand to those with who are better suited to learning with a personal experience as they are having live interaction with their teacher.</p>
				</div>
			</main>	
			<div class="pageFrame2">
				<div class="card2">
					<h4>Qualified Teaching Staff</h4>
					<p>The teachers employed by QuickClass will be real educators who are professionals in what they teach. They will have a high understanding and be qualified in the courses that they are teaching. This will involve a screening process, similar to a job interview and will guarantee that the teaching staff employed by QuickClass are qualified and provide the best possible education for the students. </p>
					<h4>Enrolment</h4>
					<p>Enrolment will be done through the home page of the site. The course that a student wishes to enroll in can be found through a search bar. This will allow for a smooth experience in finding the courses any individual would like to take part in. The overall aim is for a smooth experience in the presentation and this is extended to finding the courses to enroll in. There will also be commonly enrolled in courses on the home page as advertisements to give potential direction to those who are not sure on what they are hoping to enroll in.</p>
					<h4>Payment</h4>
					<p>Courses can be purchased in a couple of ways. The first is for personal accounts. A user with a personal account will be asked to make a payment of 20% of the course’s total cost. This is to ensure a guarantee that if a course has been allocated to several people there is already a commitment to the course. If a person does not show up to this course then the money will not be refunded unless that individual reaches out to QuickClass and makes a formal request for a refund. In situations like this there will be compassionate understanding of situations and a refund can be made. Upon completion of the course the rest of the total course cost will be asked to be paid in full, through lump sum or through payment plan. This payment plan will alleviate some of the costs to those who may be financially unable to commit to a full lump sum when the course enrollment is due.<br>
					The other payment method is for those with an enterprise account. This is meant for a workplace enrolling members of their staff in a course. These charges will not go to individuals and will instead be sent as a lump sum to the organization who will be required to make a payment in full. This is to ensure a serious commitment from the company.</p>
					<h4>Types of Accounts</h4>
					<p>There are two different account types for users of QuickClass. Personal accounts and Enterprise accounts.<br>
					Personal accounts are those used by the general public to enroll in courses. These can be linked to multiple services such as Facebook and Google Accounts. The personal account is designed to allow an individual to enroll in the course of their choosing, from anything to a hobby they are interested in, to a skill they are hoping to learn.<br>
				</div>
					
				<div class="card2">
					<p>Enterprise accounts are set up by companies and registered under their company name. They are able to add multiple users to these accounts under the one company and enroll more than one person in the same course. This allows for a company to easily manage and allocate staff to do certain courses. If a person a staff member is not required or unable to complete a course then they do not need to be signed up and the company can ask for a number of courses making sure that if they want their staff to attend the course enrollment is as smooth an experience as possible.</p>
					<h4>Types of Courses</h4>
					<p>QuickClass will offer a range of courses to users. These can include certificates used to further personal development like First Aid and Occupational Health and Safety, to courses designed around hobbies such as Playing Chess or Photography. A wide range of courses will be included with teaching staff enthusiasm and inspiration at the forefront of the learning. The courses designed around personal development will be primarily advertised to companies seeking training for staff, whilst the courses more related to hobbies and personalized skills will be advertised on personal accounts. The courses designed to be more personalized and individual focused will be ranging from multiple levels such as beginner, intermediate, and advanced, meaning if someone was hoping to learn a language and understood the basics, they could enroll in an intermediate course more suited to their needs.</p>
					<h4>Course Completion</h4>
					<p>Upon completion of a course that requires a certificate, a certificate of completion will be emailed to that accounts registered emails. For personal accounts, this will be their preferred email, however for enterprise accounts these will be emailed to the registered email of each individual employee that has been provided by the company through their account details. This will allow each staff member to acquire their certificates individually and forward them to whomever they feel appropriate. This way the company can arrange the completion of courses for their staff in a manner they deem suitable.<br>
					For courses that do not require a certificate, an email will still be provided with an acknowledgment of completion, to give the user the satisfaction of being told they have done something and can be proud of their achievement.<br>
					If the required work did not meet the teachers' standards and requires adjustments then the email will not involve a certificate or acknowledgment of completion but will instead show the user that they need to adjust their work and they are able to re-submit, or email their course teacher for clarification and specific feedback. This will be enforced on all courses but more strictly when certificates of completion are involved as courses requiring certificates will need to be completed with competency and set criteria to avoid legal issues when stating that an individual has an understanding of a specific area. For courses resulting in acknowledgement of completion, the decision to adjust work will be up the discretion of the teacher and whether they feel the participant has a sufficient understanding.

				<h4>Funding</h4>
				<p>As this is an educational program, requiring the employment of teaching staff, government funding can be requested to launch the site. This will come under the Victorian State Government Department of Education, as the state government is responsible for tertiary funding for schools, and other educational organizations. Teachers' payment, Management, and IT support costs will come from enrollment, similar to the way a schools payment structure works. NCCD can be contacted for student specific funding that QuickClass would need to organize.</p>
				<h4>Algorithmic Based Recommendations</h4>
				<p>QuickClass will aim to incorporate an algorithmic system in order to discern what a person’s study preferences are. This will involve a quiz upon starting a profile asking for details such as what industry the person works in, what hobbies they currently participate in, and what hobbies they have an interest in learning. With this information, courses with similarities will be recommended to the user to guarantee they are gaining the most from their learning on QuickClass. As the users change interest QuickClass will be able make new suggestions based on recent searches and recently participated/watched classes.</p>
				<h3>Tools + Tech</h3>
				<p>QuickClass site will be created on PHP and SQL database for Back End Development. We will use HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create the Front-End application. For site design we will use Bootstrap elements and codes. Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework. The main tool for programming is Microsoft Visual Studio - an integrated development environment from Microsoft. Another tool for connect SQL database and PHP code is XAMPP. XAMPP is a free and open-source cross-platform web server solution stack package developed by Apache Friends, consisting mainly of the Apache HTTP Server, MariaDB database, and interpreters for scripts written in the PHP and Perl programming languages.<br> 
				Live Interaction Sessions will be possible through popular programs like Zoom, Discord or built-in module in internet site. User could choose which application convenient for him for communication with teacher.<br>
				Payment process will be organized with APIs of finance companies or banks to build payment terminal in our website. Good example of that possible to find on <a href="https://developer.fisglobal.com/" target="_blank">https://developer.fisglobal.com/</a><br>
				To create an application for smartphones on iOS, one of the main languages of iOS development will be used Objective-C or Swift. The Android application development will be developed in Kotlin, which is an enhanced Java. To create applications in Kotlin, we need to have Android Studio 3.0 or later installed.
			</div>
			
			<div class="card2">
				<p>Elements of machine learning will be applied in our program.  Тhe algorithm of our program will predict with a certain accuracy what exactly the user will want to study next time.  Based on this assumption, the user will be offered a particular course or training videos.  Machine learning is increasingly being used in modern programs and we will develop this algorithm for our program.  The development of code for machine learning will be done using Google's machine learning framework - TensorFlow and Python.  We will create a software that will interact with the user and the user will have the impression that he is working with hight level of artificial intelligence.<br>
				The hardware we will use are a powerful computer, preferably two screens for comfortable coding. To develop applications for smartphones, we need to use an Android smartphone and another iOS smartphone. An internet connection is also required.</p>
				<h3>Skills</h3>
				<p>The Skills required setup and maintain a website and mobile application are extremally varying. The fundamental skills to set up and maintain a website are coding in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. As shown in the burning glass data analysis website production and programming languages like JavaScript are in extremely high demand, make possibly difficult to obtain highly qualified individuals to fill these positions. <br>
				As this is a completely web-based program that is for both teachers and students have highly trained technical support staff from level 1 through to operational management positions will be highly critical to continuing positive user engagement. While Technical support might be in high demand, this is a broad term from many different positions so finding skilled working for each sub-category should not be difficult.<br>
				While finding the back-end hardware required to run and maintain our servers and data should not be difficult as there is a large verity of vendors from HP, Dell and more unknown ones like Nutanix, that can provide hardware. We will be keeping it all on premise, there will be no cloud storage as part of our setup. It might be more difficult to find a full stuff of server and network administrators to install and maintain all the hardware.
				<h3>Outcome</h3>
				<p>Ultimately, QuickClass would be designed, implemented and deployed as a web based ‘app’. Because it is web based, it can be accessed by any device with an Internet connection and will therefore be device agnostic. Users will have the satisfaction of accessing a variety of courses led by qualified teaching staff at a time that is convenient to them. QuickClass gives a bit more of a personalised learning platform, allowing their users the ability to ask questions to their teachers, have courses suggested and attune to their interests and needs based on AI algorithm, get feedback from course work and gain course completion to add to their CVs and resumes if they wish as.</p>
