			<h3>Robots</h3>
			<h4>What is a Robot?</h4>
			<p>
			The definition of a robot is “A type of machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. (Robot noun - Definition, pictures, pronunciation and usage notes | Oxford Advanced American Dictionary at OxfordLearnersDictionaries.com, 2021) This is an extremely broad definition and can be easily misunderstood. Often when people think of robots, they are thinking about science fiction movies with robots resembling humans. Robots however refer to a substantial number of machines that already exist in our modern world. <br>
			An example of highly technological of robots currently used around the modern world is in the manufacturing industry. Robots are often used in manufacturing as they are autonomous and whilst they require maintenance, they are overall self-sufficient when given the materials needed to execute a task. For example, if a robot was programmed to pull items off of multiple assembly lines to fit them together and put them back into the assembly line for the next procedure, this could be easily done with today's technology and in fact multiple car companies are already doing this. Automation and Test Systems is a company that currently makes and ships manufacturing robots with automotive manufacturing as their leading market.

		Another example of robots currently being manufactured today are the robots designed for rescue operations. There is a myriad of robots being designed created and perfected today that are specifically built for rescue operations as a main concern to rescuing people is the potential threat to the rescue team’s safety. An example of a robot designed for rescue is the Hydronalix. The first iteration of the Hydronalix was designed in 2010 and was created to help people caught in dangerous waters. The Hydronalix works like a flotation device and gained popularity in 2016 when it was used to assist over 240 people within the first 10 days of its release to public use. (12 Examples of Rescue Robots, 2021) Robots are not only used for large scale projects such as manufacturing and rescue operations. </p>

					<td><p>Many robots are built for personal use, with a well-known example being the robotic vacuum. Commonly referred to as ‘Roombas’ by a large majority of the public, named after a specific brand, the robotic vacuum is used by many to keep their floors tidy. </p></td>
				</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Robotic vacuums work similarly to conventional vacuum cleaners; however, they are often smaller and autonomous. They are built with censors that allow the robotic vacuum to drive like a motorised car and when it bumps into something those sensors let the robotic vacuum know that it needs to turn. They are often built with only two wheels allowing the vacuum to turn on a point. This is so they can turn on any flat surface regardless of space constraints. (2021). The reason for using robotic vacuums as an example is because often people become highly attached to their personal robotic vacuums. This attachment may seem unusual, however a psychological trait many humans have is to attach human aspects to non-human objects. 
		<br>This causes people who become attached to their robotic vacuums, to treat it as a pet more than a cleaning tool. There are many examples of people becoming upset and distraught at their robotic vacuum becoming damaged in some way, even going so far as to send it to a mechanic and wait weeks for their robotic vacuum to be repaired, even when a functioning one can be given to them as a replacement immediately. The autonomous nature of robots is a major factor in how people will see humanity when they are fully aware it is a machine just following its programming. This can lead to some interesting outcomes for robots in the future.

		<h3>The Potential Impact of Robots in the Future</h3>
		<p>
		There are many impacts for the future of robots. As mentioned previously, human traits are often given to robots. This could result in robots becoming far more widely used commercially. Many people marvel at seeing a well-functioning robot perform tasks, and in Japan there are restaurants run entirely by robotic staff. This could have large impacts in not only the way people interact with robots, but how they are used to perform tasks. A likely impact of this aspect of robotics is the use of them as companions or caregivers. Robots are already being made to help elderly people with medication time and mental stimulation, through games and conversation. (Purtill 2021)</p>

		<p>
		Whilst this is just one impact of robots that could be seen in the future, another far more widespread and impact is the potential for robots to replace part of the human workforce. Whilst this sounds like something out of a sci-fi movie, robots are being produced currently to perform tasks that up until recently were entirely done by humans. Assembly line workers have already had this happen as many jobs as possible that have been traditionally done by humans in assembly lines have been taken up by robots programmed to do those tasks. There are many benefits to this as robots can perform these tasks efficiently and cost effectively. (Q&A and Hope, 2021) Robots are also able to be repaired quickly or replaced without any legal or ethical issues arising. This means that dangerous jobs such as those involved with rescue operations or other hazardous environments are perfectly suited to robots, with greatly reduced potential for workplace harm to humans. The impact of robots in the future has the potential to be enormous, especially with the efforts to make more efficient and higher functioning robots.

			<h4>The Effects of Robots on Society</h4>
			<p>
			The effects this has on the IT industry are enormous. The IT industry is built on the integration of technology into the lives of others. Robots are not only exciting to explore but have the potential to be incredibly useful to humanity. This is a major driving factor for many programmers, software engineers, IT technicians and others to pursue their careers. The more people entering IT fields to work on robotics, the faster the technology will grow. This means that people looking for IT work will need to further specialise in order to gain access into a career they hope to work in, especially with robots becoming a part of the workforce, as machine learning is allowing robots to create other robots. Whilst this may sound like a negative as fields will be more exclusive. The growing rise in robots and the technology that accompanies them will end up creating more jobs for people with the skills required to work in IT.<br>
			The affects that robots can have on the general public are also astounding. Robots could become extremely common, not only within the workplace but also in social and care-giving situations. The affects a robot can have on a person’s mental health is being studied now and could lead to companion robots for people who struggle with socialising, offering a unique friendship to members of the public. They are already affecting people with medical conditions who require support in medication as seen with the robots designed to help elderly patients. Whilst robots and robotics are not fully developed yet, humongous strides have been made in recent years allowing robots to become technologically advanced at a rate never seen in the world. They are becoming increasingly more common around the world in workplaces and the public.<br>
