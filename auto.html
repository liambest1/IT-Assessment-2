			<h3>Autonomous vehicles</h3>
			<p>
			Autonomous vehicles, or otherwise known as 'self-driving cars' is a technology that already in widespread use today. The main benefit of autonomous vehicles is safety on the roads, but there are several other benefits that we will discuss. There are 6 levels of autonomous driving, ranging from no autonomy to full autonomy. These are listed in Figure 13.
			</p>

			<p>
				The main benefit of this technology is safety. In the United States, 94% of moderate to severe car crashes are due to human error. This is a sobering statistic, considering that 35,000 people die from car related fatalities in the USA each year. Any technology that can help bring these numbers down will be widely accepted across the world. (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, year unknown)<br>
				Tesla, the car shown in Figure 14, is at the forefront of cutting-edge technology in driverless vehicles. These vehicles are outfitted with a plethora of software and hardware components that operate in tandem to scan the surrounding environment and receive updates via satellite. These vehicles employ a top-of-the-line lidar sensor that works in conjunction with inertial measurement unit sensors to determine the car's location to a quarter-inch accuracy, and an extra vibration sensitive detecting device is triggered when an option is approaching or within close range. However, to ensure that all of these two are efficient and functional when needed, the automobile is outfitted with a vehicle version of a mother board that use deep learning technology to scan for the best mathematical elements of travel destinations and collision avoidance.

		This software also does continuous computations while the car is in motion to account for natural occurrences and sends critical information to neighbouring automobiles about any harmful natural occurrence that has not been identified by satellite. This technology is quickly evolving, but more steps must be taken in the future years to coincide with the advancement of autonomous car technology and make it broadly available for the general public. As many nations would have to consider many residents still using many older models and roads; many infrastructures would need to be updated to accommodate the introduction of autonomous driving.<br>
		It is important to note that while Tesla has many autonomous features, it is still only a level 2 on the autonomy scale, meaning that at any stage, the driver may be required to take back the wheel. Teslaâ€™s founder, Elon Musk has said that he will implement level 5 full autonomy in Tesla vehicles by the end of the year, but many have their doubts. In the next 3 years, we are likely to see autonomous technology progress to level 3 and level 4 technology may just be around the corner. (Forbes 2021)<br>
		The anticipated consequence of technology such as autonomous vehicles gaining momentum is that commute times will decrease owing to AI technology exceeding human mistakes and wait periods and simplifying parking while users get out and go about their day. Another important benefit is that the cost of health care is decreasing as a result of fewer automobile accidents caused by drunk drivers, distraction, and other human mistakes, enabling residual health care and police expenditures to be reallocated elsewhere to help the economy. This will also benefit many disabled individuals who rely on public transportation to move around. They will now have a personal vehicle that will prioritize their safety and carry them from place to place faster, safer, and more effectively. Along with this autonomous vehicle, there will be a chain reaction of job redundancy and job creation. <br>With Tesla and other car manufacturers entering the self-trucking space, most people who drive trust are at risk of losing their jobs because companies already pay a third of all expenses to truck drivers' salaries. Another casualty would be taxi drivers, who would be replaced by self-driving ride-sharing alternatives, which are expected to be cheaper, safer, and faster than traditional methods in the future. Furthermore, the cost to everyday living would be drastically different, as autonomous cars come at a high cost in current day and age, with every particle and component costing money. However, as demand and supply increase, the price will fall considerably over time.

		<h4>Likely Impacts of Autonomous Vehicles</h4>
		<center><img src="images/auto3.jpg"></center>
		<p>
		The impact of autonomous vehicles on society has the potential to be life changing for many people. The effects on people who use driving or operating vehicles as a career could be in danger as more and more technologies are made in the pursuit of autonomy. Delivery industries are already being affected by technology, with Amazon using drones and ships being developed by the International Maritime Organisation to ship cargo autonomously.	 (Autonomous shipping, 2021).

		Whilst there are not currently fully autonomous vehicles being used publicly, there are tests and demonstrations being done currently to advance the technology and hopefully prove that full autonomy can be developed in daily transport. As of 2021 Ford was promising to have self-driving taxis, however blamed the global pandemic for delays in the technology and are hoping to deliver on this promise in 2022 on a small scale in Miami, Florida and Austin, Texas (Hawkins, 2021). Over time, if autonomous vehicles become the norm, vehicles that currently do not seem feasible in becoming autonomous would start to be looked at with more understanding. Arial vehicles having autonomy in development would be an enormous change in the way that intercontinental travel is made. Whilst this impact will not be relevant for the public for potentially generations, the developments could open new jobs for people looking to work in fields around technologies of autonomous vehicles. The overall impacts of autonomous vehicles on those in driver-based industries may be detrimental, however the overall affects this will have on the public could be useful and life changing in a positive way. There will need to be laws and legislations developed around the use of these autonomous vehicles and this will heavily impact the way that roads, ship routes, and airfields are utilised.
		</p>
		<h4>How Autonomous Vehicles Affect the Public</h4>
		<p>
		Affects autonomous vehicles could have on the daily life of an individual could be immense. If vehicles were to be made fully autonomous, reliable and cost effective enough for mass distribution, then theoretically all incidents of collisions and road accidents would be eradicated. This is an enormous ask though as whilst the technology is being worked on, it will be decades before that could be considered as a feasible goal. There is a lot of work that needs to be done around autonomous vehicles and currently the technology is not there to impact the lives of the average person in their transportation. Where the effects on the public could be seen however, is in the taxis and delivery services that are provided by companies willing to spend the money to invest in autonomous vehicles. There are companies currently testing their autonomous taxis in countries like China, and these seem to be going well from a marketing and public relations perspective, however more tests need to be done for the cost efficiency and overall safety of these vehicles. With delivery companies however the need for safety is not as crucial as no human injuries or casualties are likely to be sustained using autonomous vehicles this way. This could lead to deliveries via automated drones or cars. This is already becoming a reality as in Japan, the self-driving robot known as Rakuten (named after the company that it delivers for) is an autonomous vehicle designed for delivering mail and packages (Reiko, 2021). This however is not a safe method of transportation if used on a larger scale as there are many issues with its pathfinding that still currently need fixing. </p>

			There are unlikely to be any significant effects on the publicâ€™s day to day activities due to autonomous vehicles outside of pay per ride trips and those who work in driver-based industries as those are the current focusses of the technology right now. Industries of delivery will however be affected as they are already currently using autonomy on their delivery methods and this trend will continue to grow.</p>
