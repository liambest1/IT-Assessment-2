                My name is Liam Best and my student number is s3923908 and my team is Team Exodus.<br />
                My family on my Mum’s side is Australian born for at least 4 Generations and on my Dad’s
                side, my Grandfather is Welsh and moved to Australia during World War Two when he was
                about 4.
                My education so far is the completion of year 12 in 2014, where I went straight into
                university at Victoria University to study Criminal Justice (Criminal Law cross with Sociology)
                as at the time I wanted to join the Police. As the course went on, I lost interest and when I
                was offered an IT job, I jumped at the opportunity and left Uni in 2016. I am an avid reader
                but only started this hobby since the first lockdown in March 2020 and since then I have not
                stopped. I have read nearly 25 books in 18 months, which is more than I have read leisurely
                than the rest of my life combine.
